# Flask-WebApp

Hello, this is my Stock Exchange Web Application that I made through Flask in CS50. To run it, you first have to configure an API key to receive the current financial data on each stock. I used IEX's data which you can register for free at https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/. 
In the terminal window, type: ``export API_KEY=(your key)`` After that run app.py and you should be able to access the web application as normal.
